# Fake News Detection

This app can be used to distinguish fake news from a real one. 

I've used supervised learning to implement the model.

It includes:
>      -  Text pre-processing techniques
>      -  NLP Techniques ( TF-iDF, Bag-of-words)
>      -  Logistic Regression
>      -  Evaluation metrics and confusion matrix.
